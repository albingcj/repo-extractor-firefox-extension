## Limitations

- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: The extension uses the GitHub API, which has rate limits for unauthenticated requests. If you encounter rate limit issues, you may need to modify the code to include a GitHub personal access token in the request headers.
- **Repository Size**: The extension may struggle with very large repositories due to API limitations and performance constraints.
- **Nested Directories**: The extension currently supports nested directories but may have performance issues with deeply nested structures.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some planned features and enhancements for the extension:

- [ ] **Fold/Unfold Tree Structure**: Add the ability to fold and unfold directories in the tree for better navigation.
- [ ] **Select and Download Files**: Allow users to select specific files from the tree and download them directly.
- [ ] **Generate Combined Text File**: Provide an option to generate a combined text file from selected files in the tree.
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Add a dark mode option for better usability in low-light environments.
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature to quickly find files or directories within the tree.
- [ ] **Export as JSON/CSV**: Add options to export the file tree as JSON or CSV for further analysis.
- [ ] **Customizable Tree View**: Allow users to customize the tree view (e.g., show/hide file extensions, sort by name/type).
